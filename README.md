# poem-gen

Simple n-gram based Mayakovsky poetry generation with some tricks and hacks. This is a little fun example project for my NLP class.

Go to examples.md to read some machine-generated "Mayakovsky" poetry.

Upd: I also added a very simple notebook where I train a ruGPT-3-small transformer language model on Mayakovsky poems.
